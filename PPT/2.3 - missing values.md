# Missing values

In every data there are missing values. Sometimes a lot of values are missing in a row, sometimes a lot in a column. First step is to find where they are.

For this you can use DataFrame.info() in pandas, it displays the number of non-null values: ([example](https://datascienceparichay.com/article/pandas-get-dataframe-summary-with-info/))

```Python
# get dataframe summary
df.info()
```

```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 4 entries, 0 to 3
Data columns (total 3 columns):
 #   Column      Non-Null Count  Dtype  
---  ------      --------------  -----  
 0   Name        4 non-null      object 
 1   Age         3 non-null      float64
 2   Department  3 non-null      object 
dtypes: float64(1), object(2)
memory usage: 224.0+ bytes
```

So suppose there are a lot of Na-values. Then what?

Handling missing values is an important step in preparing structured data for machine learning. Here are some common strategies for dealing with missing values:

# Remove rows or columns (amputation)

If the missing values are in a small number of rows or columns, you may choose to remove those rows or columns from the dataset. However, this approach should be used with caution as it can lead to a loss of valuable information.

# Imputation

Imputation involves replacing missing values with estimated or predicted values. There are various techniques for imputing missing values, including:
- Mean/Median/Mode Imputation: Replace missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the available values in the respective column.
- Regression Imputation: Use regression models to predict missing values based on other variables.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation: Replace missing values with the average of the values from the nearest neighbors in terms of other variables.
- Multiple Imputation: Generate multiple imputed datasets by estimating missing values using statistical models, and then analyze the results from each imputed dataset.

An example of a simple imputation can be found in "Scripts/2.3 - missing values.ipynb".

## Special value imputation
Sometimes, it may be appropriate to replace missing values with a specific value that represents their absence. For example, you can assign a distinct value such as "Unknown" or "None" to indicate missing values.

## Indicator variable
Create an additional binary indicator variable that represents the presence or absence of missing values. This way, the missingness information can be captured by the model and potentially provide useful insights.

## Advanced techniques:
There are more sophisticated techniques available for handling missing values, such as using machine learning algorithms specifically designed for missing data, like Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms or probabilistic graphical models. These methods can handle missing data in a more principled and integrated manner.

## SKlearn imputer

# Summary

__The choice of strategy depends on the specific dataset, the amount and pattern of missing data, and the nature of the problem you are trying to solve. It is important to understand the reasons behind the missing values and consider the potential impact of each strategy on the integrity and interpretability of the data.__

Before applying any method, it is crucial to carefully analyze the missing data patterns, evaluate the assumptions of the imputation technique, and assess the potential impact on the downstream analysis or model performance.

(Example: in a dataset with student grades, I once replaced "passed" and "not passed" with 16 and 6 respectively. This allowed me to do calculations on this column, but it did give annoying spikes in my density graphs.)
