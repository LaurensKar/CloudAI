# Ordinal and nominal

Categorical data is a type of data that represents distinct groups or categories. It is used to classify and label data based on certain characteristics or attributes. Categorical data is often qualitative in nature and does not have a numerical value or measurement associated with it.

Categorical data can be further divided into two main subtypes: nominal and ordinal, as explained below. Nominal data represents categories that do not have an inherent order or ranking, while ordinal data represents categories with a specific order or hierarchy.

Examples of categorical data include:

1. Gender: Categorized as male or female.
2. Marital Status: Categorized as single, married, divorced, widowed, etc.
3. Educational Level: Categorized as high school, college, graduate degree, etc.
4. Hair Color: Categorized as black, brown, blonde, red, etc.
5. Vehicle Type: Categorized as car, truck, motorcycle, bicycle, etc.

It is important to note that categorical data cannot be subjected to numerical operations or calculations, such as addition or multiplication. However, various statistical techniques and methods exist to analyze categorical data, such as chi-square tests, contingency tables, and frequency distributions.

Ordinal and nominal are two different types of categorical data that are used to classify and categorize information. They are used in various fields, such as statistics, data analysis, and research.

## Nominal Data
Nominal data represents categories or labels that do not have any inherent order or ranking. In this type of data, the categories are simply different from one another, with no numerical or logical relationship. For example, colors, gender, marital status, or types of fruit are nominal variables. Each category is distinct and does not have any relative position or hierarchy. Nominal data is typically represented using labels or names, and no mathematical operations can be performed on it. The only operations that can be applied to nominal data are counting and frequency calculations.

Example: A survey asking individuals to choose their favorite color (red, blue, green, yellow) would yield nominal data.

## Ordinal Data
Ordinal data, on the other hand, represents categories that have a natural order or ranking between them. The categories in ordinal data can be arranged in a meaningful order or sequence, indicating the relative magnitude or position of each category. However, the intervals between categories may not be uniform or measurable. Ordinal data is often collected through rating scales, questionnaires, or surveys with response options that have a specific order. Some examples of ordinal variables include ratings of satisfaction (e.g., very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied) or educational attainment levels (e.g., elementary, high school, bachelor's, master's, doctorate).

Example: A survey asking participants to rate their level of agreement on a scale of 1 to 5 (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree) would yield ordinal data.

In summary, the main difference between nominal and ordinal data lies in the presence or absence of a natural ordering or hierarchy among the categories. Nominal data represents unordered categories, while ordinal data represents categories with a meaningful order or ranking.

(Or you could look at the diamonds exercise. It has a great example of ordinal, categorical data: the type of cut.)

# One hot encoding

One-hot encoding is a technique used to represent categorical variables as binary vectors. It is a process of transforming categorical data into a numerical format that can be more easily understood and processed by machine learning algorithms.

One-hot encoding creates a new binary feature for each unique category in a categorical variable. Each binary feature represents whether an observation belongs to a specific category or not. If an observation falls into a particular category, the corresponding binary feature is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.

Here's an example to illustrate the concept of one-hot encoding:

Suppose we have a categorical variable called "Fruit" with three categories: Apple, Banana, and Orange. One-hot encoding would transform this variable into three binary features: "Apple," "Banana," and "Orange." If an observation represents an Apple, the "Apple" feature would be set to 1 and the "Banana" and "Orange" features would be set to 0.

Original Categorical Variable:
Fruit: Apple

One-Hot Encoded Variables:
Apple: 1
Banana: 0
Orange: 0

One-hot encoding is commonly used when working with machine learning algorithms, as many algorithms require numerical inputs. By converting categorical variables into numerical representations, it allows algorithms to process and understand the data. One-hot encoding helps avoid the issue of assigning numerical values to categorical variables that could introduce unintended relationships or order between the categories.

It's important to note that one-hot encoding increases the dimensionality of the data, which can impact computation and memory requirements. Additionally, if a categorical variable has a large number of categories, one-hot encoding may result in a high number of binary features, potentially leading to the "curse of dimensionality." In such cases, feature selection or other techniques may be employed to mitigate these challenges.
