# The project part 2
## Data science, data exploration

The 'difficult' dataset is a dataset about crops. You can find it in the zip-file called 'food-twentieth-century-crop-statistics-1900-2017-xlsx'. Besides the actual data it also contains a pdf-file describing what all the fields stand for.

Take this week to start exploring this dataset. Remember the steps:

- Import and clean your data (dates, categoricals, ...)
- Draw a graph
- Try to see a pattern or an interesting outlier
- Draw another graph to confirm this suspicion
- Try to see a pattern or an interesting outlier
- Draw another graph to confirm this suspicion
- Try to see a pattern or an interesting outlier
- Draw another graph to confirm this suspicion
- ...

The final project will be partly graded on building a model based on this data, but also on the exploration of the data. Doing this step thorough will also greatly increase the quality of your model.
