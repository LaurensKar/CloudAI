# Discussion topics part 1

## General statistics:
1. The chances of somebody dying on their birthday are 13% higher than on any other day. Is this possible? Explain. On your birthday you often do special activities like skydiving which are obviously more dangerous than what you might do on a normal day like sitting in class listening to your teacher.
1. What does the following graph say about the test of which it represents the scores? A: Most of the students will not have passed the class but there are a few who did resulting in a left skewered graph.

1. The following graph tries to make the point that global warming is out of control. But what is wrong with it? This graph proves that seasonal changes are a thing but isn't nearly long enough to show that global warming is out of control.

1. Under which conditions can a pie chart be used? When the data allows for categories and adds up to 100%.
1. Explain the difference between “variation” and “covariation” with an example of our hypothetical student-grade-dataset. A: Variance refers to the spread of a data set around its mean value, while covariance refers to the measure of the directional relationship between two random variables
1. What is the difference between a bar plot and a histogram? When do we use them? Bar plot is used for categorical data and an histogram for quantative data (50,55,60).
1. How can you explore covariation? Are there different graphs that we can use? A:Exploring covariation involves examining the relationship between two or more variables to understand how they change together. Some graphs you can use are the following: Scatter plots, Line graphs, heatmaps.
1. Explain covariance and correlation with an example.
A: Covariance measures how two variables change together. It can be positive (both increase or decrease) or negative (one increases while the other decreases). However, it lacks standardization, making it difficult to compare. For example, consider the heights and weights of a group of people.

Correlation is a standardized measure of the relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1. A positive correlation (close to 1) means they move in the same direction, while a negative correlation (close to -1) means they move in opposite directions. For example, the correlation between study hours and exam scores.

## Ethics in AI

1. Suppose we record all information on our students (gender, race, height, shoe size, schooling history, profession of parents, …) and use this to only allow students with a reasonable chance of succeeding to start in the first year. Would that be a good idea? Would it be an ethical idea? A: indeed good but extremely unethical.
(Good: something that works, that does what it is supposed to, Ethical: Being in accordance with the accepted principles of right and wrong that govern the conduct of a profession. E.g., robbing a bank is a good idea because it gets you a lot of money fast, but it isn’t an ethical idea because it is illegal and people may die.)
1. Suppose we record all school-related information on our students (class attendance, exam results, how long they studied, …) and compare this with the results of students finishing the first year, it would give us an insight in their chances of finishing our program in a timely fashion.
What if we forbid students that we think would not finish or take more than 4 years to continue in our program. Would that be a good/ethical idea? Neither a good idea or ethical idea. The school still benefits a lot from students even if they stay more than 4 years and of course unethical because everybody should be given a chance.
What if we wouldn’t forbid them, but simply gave them a very strong warning (unless you dramatically change some of these parameters, you won’t be finishing this program according to the data). Would that be a good/ethical idea?
A: This would be a good idea because it would motivate more to learn more. Not that unethical, it is just supportive feedback where they try their best to help you by showing you the facts.

## Group forming

1. Let everyone in your group take a random personality test (Enneagram, Typefinder or MBTI, Big Five Assessment, Career Profiler, Workplace DISC Test, …). Compare these totally unrelated results. Laurens: ENTP
1. Generate a couple of random roles using https://www.randomlists.com/random-jobs (you can rerun as much as necessary). Assign all team members a role with description of tasks. 
Data Analyst: Laurens
Description: A Data Analyst is responsible for collecting, processing, and analyzing data to help organizations make informed decisions. They use various tools and techniques to identify trends, generate reports, and provide insights that support business strategies. Data Analysts often work with databases, spreadsheets, and data visualization tools to present their findings in a clear and understandable way.

Data Scientist: Wouter
Description: Data Scientists are experts in using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to extract valuable insights from data. They work with large datasets to build predictive models, develop algorithms, and uncover patterns that can drive business growth or solve complex problems. Data Scientists also play a crucial role in data-driven decision-making by providing actionable recommendations to stakeholders.

Data Engineer: Kieran
Description: Data Engineers design and maintain the infrastructure for collecting, storing, and processing data. They work on developing and optimizing databases, data pipelines, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. Data Engineers ensure data quality, scalability, and accessibility, enabling Data Analysts and Data Scientists to work with clean and reliable data. They often use programming languages like Python, SQL, and tools like Hadoop and Spark.
1. The three of you start a company that specializes in data management. Think of a name. Write (or let some AI generate) a company introduction and mission statement. 
Name: Data Wizards
Introduction:

Mission statement:
Our mission at Data Wizards is to harness the power of data to drive innovation, provide actionable insights, and empower organizations for a data-driven future.
1. Use another AI-model to generate a company image, preferably something that is reflected in your company name. 
1. Create a markdown file with your company information, a professional picture of every one of you along with your job title and tasks. Upload this in your github as “README.md” and post the link to the repo in the team chat you made that included the instructor.
